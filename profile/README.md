# 🦅 FemtoClaw Organization

> Industrial Agent Runtime. Rust-native. Deterministic. Production-grade.

Welcome to the official FemtoClaw organization.

FemtoClaw is an industrial agent runtime — a lightweight, Rust-based execution authority that safely mediates probabilistic inference systems and deterministic computing environments.

It enables secure, observable, and correct deployment of agent systems in enterprise and production infrastructure.

# ⚙️ What FemtoClaw Is

FemtoClaw is not a framework.

FemtoClaw is not an orchestration wrapper.

FemtoClaw is a runtime authority.

It provides:

• Deterministic execution control  
• Protocol-validated inference mediation  
• Capability-gated tool execution  
• Memory-safe runtime guarantees  
• Production-grade performance and deployment characteristics  

FemtoClaw defines its own class of infrastructure: the industrial agent runtime.

# 🧠 Runtime Architecture

FemtoClaw separates inference from execution authority.

Inference System → FemtoClaw Runtime → Capability Gate → System Execution

This ensures:

• Inference cannot execute actions directly  
• All execution passes through validated capability gates  
• Execution safety is enforced at the runtime level

# 🚀 Quick Start

Install FemtoClaw:

cargo install femtoclaw

Run FemtoClaw:

femtoclaw run

Run a single execution:

femtoclaw once "summarize system status"

Run in local-only mode:

femtoclaw run --brain local

---

# 🔐 Execution Safety Model

FemtoClaw enforces strict execution safety through:

• Protocol-validated structured outputs  
• Capability-gated execution  
• Memory-safe Rust runtime  
• Explicit execution authority boundaries  

Inference systems cannot execute actions directly.

FemtoClaw executes actions.

# ⚡ Performance Characteristics

Typical runtime characteristics:

Startup time: ~2–10 ms  
Memory footprint: ~5–20 MB  
Binary size: ~2–5 MB  
Execution overhead: Microseconds per step  

FemtoClaw is optimized for:

• Enterprise infrastructure  
• Edge deployment  
• CI/CD automation  
• Secure environments  
• Air-gapped systems  

---

# 🧪 Compliance and Certification

FemtoClaw provides a full compliance and certification framework:

• Compliance test suite  
• Runtime conformance validation  
• Safety guarantee verification  
• Determinism validation  
• Performance verification  

This ensures production readiness.

---

# 🧰 Extensibility

FemtoClaw supports extension through:

• Capability modules ("Claws")  
• Custom inference providers ("Brains")  
• Custom memory backends  
• Protocol extensions  

The runtime authority remains invariant.

---

# 🌐 Deployment Targets

FemtoClaw runs anywhere Rust runs:

• Linux  
• macOS  
• Windows  
• Containers  
• Edge devices  
• Air-gapped systems  

Single binary deployment.

No runtime dependencies required.
